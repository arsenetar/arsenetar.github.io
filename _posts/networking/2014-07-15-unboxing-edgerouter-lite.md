Today, I received the [Ubiquity EdgeRouter Lite](http://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-lite/)
as a replacement to my current [pfSense](https://pfsense.org/) router. I have
been using pfSense on a custom computer for the past few years and got the
EdgeRouter Lite as an attempt to reduce power consumption (pfSense system uses
56W via Kill-a-Watt).  I will follow up this review with a more detailed comparison between the
two setups after I have used the EdgeRouter Lite for a month or so.  Anyhow
without further back-story, the unboxing:

## Packaging
The EdgeRouter Lite comes in a standard retail box with product images and basic
specifications around the box. The front of the box shows an image of the router
as an isometric view.  The device I received is the newer version which has the
metal casing instead of the original version's plastic cover.

The first side of the box shows ta couple screenshots of the web interface which
seems fairly user friendly and lists the default IP and user information.

The back of the box shows the top and front views of the router showing the three
Ethernet ports, the console port and the reset switch.

The second side of the box shows some of the product specifications and lists the
box contents.

Upon opening the top of the box a formed cardboard tray pulls out to reveal the
quick start guide on top of the router.  Below the router is the power supply and
mounting screws.

Overall, the packaging seems decent and is what I would expect for a product of
this type.

## Contents
Moving on, removing the contents from the packaging gives a better idea about the
device.  The contents are shown below and consist of the quick start guide, the
router, the power supply (3.5 ft cord), 2ft power supply cable, and mounting
hardware.

The power supply is a custom branded 12 Volt 1 Amp supply (12W out max) capable
of accepting 100-240 Volt AC.  This alone shows that the router should be much
more power efficient than my pfSense setup.

Should the router be wall mounted, screws and plugs have been included, however
I prefer to use drywall screws instead of the screws and plugs provided with
these sort of devices.

## Physical
The router is enclosed in a two piece metal enclosure which is held together by
three small screws in the back and a lip in the front.  The casing feels sturdy
enough and has perforations on the top and three sides to assist in heat dissipation.
The top of the router has the Ubiquiti logo and the device name in the center.

The front of the router contains the three Ethernet ports each 1000Mbps  (1Gbps)
labeled `eth0-2`.  Next to them is the legend for the indicator lights.  The console
port is to the left and is labeled `CONSOLE`.  The console port is for use with
the Cisco style cable and a COM port.  On the far right is the reset switch for
if/when things go wrong.

Moving to the back of the router has the DC power input jack and the grounding
clamp.

![Router Back]({{ site.url }}/images/2014-07-15/RouterBack.JPG)

The bottom of the router has four small rubber feet for setting the device on
a flat surface.  Given the low weight of the device though it may want to slide
once cables are connected though.  Across the center are the two mounting holes
which are setup to allow vertical or horizontal mounting of the device.

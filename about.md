The contents of this blog cover topics such as electrical projects, coding, and product reviews.  These topics are resultant from personal hobbies and projects.  The electrical projects consist of things such as motor controllers, battery management systems, and audio amplifiers.  The coding articles are targeted mainly at web development using python or php with frameworks such as [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [slim](http://www.slimframework.com/).  The reviews are targeted at technology products and computer components.

## The Author (whoami)
I am an undergraduate engineering student at Purdue University studying Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering with a focus on power systems. While at Purdue, I have participated on an Evgradprix team for three years through Eta Kappa Nu: Beta Chapter.  Additionally I maintain the information systems of Eta Kappa Nu: Beta Chapter. In 2013, I started work on a custom battery management and balancing system for the Evgradprix entry as well.

I am interested in power generation and distribution on both a grid scale and within self contained environments (vehicles etc). With a focus on how to use existing technologies to solve the current problems faced in power generation and distribution.

## The Author (whoami)
I am an electrical design engineer working in the construction equipment industry.  I am interested in power generation and distribution on both a grid scale and within self contained environments (vehicles etc). My current focus is on how to use existing technologies to solve the current problems faced in power generation and distribution.
